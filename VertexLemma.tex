\section{The Vertex-Vertex Lemma}

%prove stated theorems and lemmas
%2.4 uniform bound on uniform neighborhood  bound on the diameter of the cells for the surface area



\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:vertvert}
Given an isolated minimum for the area $A(\theta)$ of the half-length parallelogram at $\theta_0$, then $\mathbf{p_1}$ is the only vertex of the affine diameter to meet a vertex of $K$, and no vertices of the half-length parallelogram meet a vertex of $K$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
To any vertex of $K$ we may associate an entering angle and a leaving angle, the direction from which the sweeping affine diameter and the moving vertices of the half-length parallelogram enter and leave the vertex.  %the past and the future!

We work with a parameter $t$ which is proportional to $\theta$ as in the analysis of the rate constants in section \ref{}, but may change across critical angles. Consider some configuration where some subset $\mathcal{P}$ of the vertices $\mathbf{p_2}$, $\mathbf{p_3}$, $\mathbf{p_4}$, $\mathbf{p_5}$, $\mathbf{p_6}$ meet vertices of $K$.

We may assume vertices of the half-length parallelogram do not coincide with the vertices of $K$ for any sufficiently small neighborhood of in the domain of $\theta_0$.  Otherwise, we are in the situation described in Lemma \ref{} and there is a family of minima. 

 Since this configuration is an isolated local minimum of $A(t)$ or equivalently of $A(t)$, the left derivative of $A(t)$ is negative and the right derivative is positive.  Then the stability condition \ref{} determines a family of motions which define a family of virtual polygons with the same affine diameter and the same half-length parallelogram but for which the area of the half length quadrilateral is constant.  We will show that there is a virtual polygon that contains the vertices $\mathcal{P}$ in the interior of its edges.
 
 We compute $dA/dt$ to be
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
 -&\frac{1}{2} p_{21} \sin \left(\phi _3\right) \sin \left(\phi_2-\phi _4\right) \csc \left(\phi_2-\phi _3\right)+
 \frac{1}{2} p_{21} \sin \left(\phi_2\right) \sin \left(\phi _3-\phi _4\right) \csc \left(\phi_2-\phi _3\right)+\\
 &\frac{1}{2} p_{22}\sin \left(\phi_2-\phi _4\right) \cos \left(\phi _3\right) \csc \left(\phi_2-\phi _3\right)-
  \frac{1}{2} p_{22} \sin \left(\phi _3-\phi _4\right) \cos \left(\phi_2\right) \csc \left(\phi_2-\phi _3\right)-\\
  & \frac{1}{2} p_{61} \sin \left(\phi_5\right) \sin \left(\phi _4-\phi _6\right) \csc \left(\phi _5-\phi _6\right)+
   \frac{1}{2} p_{61} \sin \left(\phi _4-\phi_5\right) \sin \left(\phi _6\right) \csc \left(\phi _5-\phi _6\right)-\\
  & \frac{1}{2} p_{62} \sin \left(\phi _4-\phi _5\right)\cos \left(\phi _6\right) \csc \left(\phi _5-\phi _6\right)+
   \frac{1}{2} p_{62} \sin \left(\phi _4-\phi _6\right) \cos \left(\phi _5\right) \csc \left(\phi _5-\phi _6\right)+\\
  & \frac{1}{4} \sin \left(\phi_2\right) \sin \left(\phi _3-\phi _4\right)\csc \left(\phi_2-\phi _3\right)+
   \frac{1}{4} \sin \left(\phi _4-\phi _5\right) \sin \left(\phi _6\right) \csc \left(\phi_5-\phi _6\right)
       \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

 We will refer to a collection of inclinations $\{\phi_i\}$ for which $dA/dt = 0$ as a set of supports.
 
Provided the coincidences of the supports $\phi_2 = \phi_3 \text{ mod } \pi$ or $\phi_5 = \phi_6 \text{ mod }\pi$ can be excluded, the derivative is a continuous function with of those angles.  But these occur only when points $\mathbf{p}_i$ meet adjacent vertices of $K$, so the half-length parallelogram shares a full edge with $K$.  By Lemma \ref{}....

%If $the left derivative is 0... just continue... by definition of vertex...$
%if the right derivative is 0, backtrack... but if the ends  of the affine diameter are both on vertices, need to back track to it and show that it has a support.  Then this is the edge to perturb along, since it forces the degrees 

If the left derivative is negative, so $dA/dt <= 0$ when evaluated at the entering, and similarly the right derivative is strictly positive, so the $dA/dt >0$ then by the intermediate value principle, we can take the convex combination of the vector of entering angles and the vector of leaving angles and find a set of support angles that lie between them. By definition the area of the half-length parallelogram is preserved to first order as $dA/d\theta = 0$ if the vertices move along such an edge, so any increase in volume must be quadratic in $t$.  However, the area lost by the discrepancy between the supports and the leaving angles is linear in $t$.

based on the signs of the we know there exists a set of slopes consistent with the property that  increasing $\theta$ gives only a quadratic increase in area (the gain from the $d\theta=0$ motion), but a linear decrease (the discrepancy in the the $d\theta$ slope and the slopes of the polygon.).    See this by noticing that the

The places where this argument breaks down are exactly when there are vertices of the half-length parallelogram or the moving vertex of the affine diameter that have parallel support.  This corresponds to a ...
